# About Face And Digit Classifier
This is a machine learning application that involves a face classifier and a digit classifier. The face classifier takes a series of train images after which it predicts whether an image is a face or not. Similarly, the digit classifier also takes a series of train images after which it predicts which digit is displayed on an image. This application utilizes a perceptron classification algorithm that defines the features to be the individual pixels that comprise each input image. Includes back-end development.
# How To Run Face Classifier
To run the face classifier, first download the Face Classifier project folder then run the "FaceClassifier.py" file in the source code. Afterwards, the application will take a moment to process the training data (this should only take a few seconds). The application will then run through the testing data and display its predictions in the terminal.
# How to Run Digit Classifier
To run the digit classifier, first download the Digit Classifer project folder then run the "DigitClassifier.py" file in the source code. Afterwards, the application will take a moment to process the training data (this will take around 3 - 5 minutes). The application will then run through the testing data and display its predictions in the terminal.
